## 1) Topic and Search Parameters

The topic that I chose for this lab is understanding the public discourse behind the Israel-Hamas conflict narrative on YouTube. The search parameters for this project are 'Israel' and 'Gaza'.


## 2) Reasons for comparison

The reasons for comparison is to understand the different narratives and perspectives of news outlets surrounding the current Israel-Hamas war. Through analyzing this comparison, we have the ability to view public perception and other insights into biases and other narratives through online platforms.


## 3) Comparison of Word Clouds

When comparing both of the word clouds that were generated, it appeared that there were key similarities as well as defining differences. The similarities were that a lot of the key terms were 'death', 'war', and 'conflict/crisis', illustrating overalapping sentiments of both sides.

However, a few terms that were distinct to the Israel wordcloud were lot of Iranian-backed proxy militants and other surrounding Arab countries around it. Some examples include 'Hezbollah', 'Hamas', 'Syria', 'Iran'. In addition to this, there were lots of verb-based terms, such as 'airstrike', 'kills', 'opposes', and 'warns'.

With Gaza, some of the key terms were more generalized, with some being 'deaths', 'bombs', 'toll', and 'crisis'.
